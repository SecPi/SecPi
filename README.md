# SecPi Alarm System

## About

SecPi is an open source project which gives people the ability to build their
own inexpensive, expandable and feature-rich alarm system.

We tailored the system to run on the Raspberry Pi but other platforms like the
Banana Pi and any other Linux machines should be capable to run the software too.

With SecPi it is also possible to connect multiple systems via network and have
them work together.

Please visit the [wiki pages](https://github.com/SecPi/SecPi/wiki) for more information.
